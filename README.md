### Project summary
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
For the project, a data set is provided which contains data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung
Galaxy S smartphone.

### General data description
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained (link as provided by the project assignment):

>The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed >six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy >S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular >velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset >has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% >the test data.
>
>The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width >sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and >body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational >force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each >window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' >for more details.

>For each record it is provided:
>======================================
>
>- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
>- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
>- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
>- Its activity label. 
>- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
>
>The dataset includes the following files:
>=========================================
>
>- 'README.txt'
>- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
>- 'features.txt': List of all features.
>- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
>- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
>- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
>- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
>- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

>The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.

## Process creating the first data set
***
The process of creating the first tidy data set can be outlined as follows:
1. Download file
2. Unzip file
3. Read activity data and features file
4. Clean the column names (as provided in features file): meeting requirement #
